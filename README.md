# Time Table Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

The Time Table Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm project is an automated system developed to generate optimized schedules for educational institutions, including schools. The system utilizes the power of Genetic Algorithms to create schedules that adhere to complex constraints such as student batches, teacher preferences, and course subject slots.

## Key Features

- **Genetic Algorithm:** The project employs Genetic Algorithms, a powerful optimization technique, to create schedules that meet complex scheduling constraints.

- **Efficiency:** By automating the scheduling process, the project streamlines the often tedious and time-consuming task of creating schedules for educational institutions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The project is implemented in Java, a versatile and widely used programming language.

## Getting Started
